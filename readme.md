Added Pawn, Rook, and Knight Movements

Rooks and Knights were pretty easy, didn't take much time. 
Pawns on the other hand were a struggle. 
Took a while to grasp my head around, but I now at least understand how all the code is working. 
Spent a good bit of time refractoring as well, hopefully this will help me in the long run.
Definetly more readable now.
